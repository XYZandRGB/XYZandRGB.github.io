    <h1>Outdoor "Compass and Straight-Edge" Constructions</h1>
    <h2>
	<p>
		<pre>
		The first year that I taught this geometry course, I noticed that students were having more difficulty than usual in making geometric constructions using a compass and straight-edge. In my estimation, one of the issues with this exercise was that students fail to see the possibility of any practical application for making these kinds of constructions.
		<br>
		<br>
		I have some students studying Landscape Architecture who take geometry as a required course, and I wanted to make a task that catered to their interests. I wanted to put my students in an environment where measuring distance with a ruler was less practical than using some basic tools. 
		After approaching the topic this way, there was a marked increase in studentsâ€™ test scores with these types of problems on exams. 
		<br>
		<br>
		I believe part of this increase was due to the conversations that groups had with each other, as well as the conversations I had with students out on the field. Before letting them move onto the next task, I made sure that each group could confidently explain their process.
